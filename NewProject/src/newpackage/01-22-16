Exceptions

In a single java class you can have multiple classes but only one Public class

Comments
// single line

/** enter and it automatically ends the comments

select the block and Ctrl + Shift + / will comment the selected block of code

goto w3schools.com and start learning html

There are 50 keywords in Java and should know by hardd by the end of this course

Data Types:

byte		8  -128 To 127
short		16 
int			32
long		64

Double 		64
Float		32  Float is represented by f at the end of floating point Ex: 3.55f

char  char = 8 bits
boolean


Cntrl + Shift + F will format the code

there two data types
primitive data types..8
wrapper data types...will learn them later down the line

local variable - always declared inside a method
instance variables - declared first thing in the class or ourside of all methods
Global variables..

When you try to assign smaller data type to bigger data type ....You will get Type mismatch: Can not convert from float to integer
Most of the times there is problem in assigning bigger data type to small..like int a = 50; short a1 = a;

Try to open debug and play around all the features of the debug.
